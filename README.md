# 🚴‍♂️ Tick Tock, Pedal Clock: Hourly Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

![Bike Demand Time Warp](Designer.png)

## 🎭 Welcome to the Bicycle Time Machine!

Ever wondered how many bikes will be zipping around the city in the next hour? Welcome to **"Tick Tock, Pedal Clock"** - where we're turning the chaotic world of hourly bike-sharing into a well-tuned Swiss watch! (With spokes, of course)

## 🕵️‍♀️ The Case of the Hourly Bike Flux

Picture this: It's 2 PM on a sunny Tuesday, and you're tasked with ensuring there are enough bikes for the 3 PM rush. Cue the suspenseful tick-tock! 🕒

Our mission: Predict bike demand with the precision of an atomic clock, but for wheels instead of atoms.

## 🔮 Our Hourly Crystal Ball (Now with Gears!)

We're not just guessing based on how many coffees the city has collectively consumed. We've built a prediction model so accurate, it could probably tell you how many bikes will be rented in the next hour... and in which gear!

### What We're Clocking:
- 🧠 A brain that learns from hourly bike-sharing patterns
- 🔍 A magnifying glass to spot hourly demand spikes and dips
- 💡 Insights more precise than a bike mechanic's torque wrench

## 🛠️ Our Time-Tuning Toolkit

1. **Hourly Data Detangling**: We're combing through time series data like we're preparing for the world's most complex chronograph.
2. **Temporal Feature Engineering**: Transforming timestamps into predictive gold. It's like turning sand into silicon... for our data chips!
3. **Regression Model Marathon**: We're putting our algorithms through more rigorous testing than a bike's odometer.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning Tango**: Fine-tuning our model with the precision of a watchmaker adjusting gears.
5. **Real-time Deployment Dash**: Rolling out our model to predict faster than you can say "It's bike o'clock!"

## 📊 The "Great Scott!" Results

| Metric | Score | In Human Speak |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| MAE | 2.04 | We're off by fewer bikes per hour than you have fingers! |
| RMSE | 3.15 | Our hourly predictions are smoother than a bike's cadence meter |
| R² | 0.94 | We're explaining more hourly variance than there are minutes on a clock face |
